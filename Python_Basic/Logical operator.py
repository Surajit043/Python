# logical Operations
a = int (input ( )) # store value in LHS variable <---- value
b = int (input ( ))

# equality operator ( == )
print (a==b)


# is operator (is) ----> use with variable
print (a is b)

# actually the basic diffrance between equality operator and is operator is :
# equality operator chack the values of two input ----> if value of a = value of b then output shows as true .
#                                 ------> if value of a is not equal to value of b then output shows as false .
# is operator actually be like ----> if id(a) = id(b), then its output be True
#                            ------> if id(a) is not equal to id(b) , then output shows as False.

# less than operator
print (a<b)

# less than equal to operator
print (a<=b)

# grater than operator
print (a>b)

# grater than equqals to operator
print (a>=b)

# or operator
# print (False or False )       # False
# print (False or Truie )       # True
# print ( True or False)        # True
# prinr ( True or True )        # True


# and operator
# print (False or False )            # False
# print ( False or True )            # False
# print ( True or False )            # False
# print ( True or True )             # True
